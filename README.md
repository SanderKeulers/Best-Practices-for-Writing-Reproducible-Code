This is the readme file for my project

This project is created in and tested for Python 3.12. Any version of Python > 3 will likely work. 

The required packages for this project are mentioned in the requirements.in file. 

The project does currently not require any input data.

The main.py function is the main function, which can be called. You can either call it directly or run plots.py to create the generated plot in the ./results/ directory. 

Compensating fluxes need to defined manually dependent on model setup. Volume of each box needs to be conserved; i.e. Q_in = sum(Q_out)
