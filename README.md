## What does this project do
Dependent on the chosen configuration, parameters and initial values, this project calculates the evolution of the water properties of any semi-enclosed sea. 
For this project, a box-model setup of the Mediterranean Sea is chosen, which is semi-enclosed and only connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Strait of Gibraltar. 
The current parameters and initial values realistically present the current-day properties of the Mediterranean Sea. Given any initial values, the evolution of temperature and salinity of the Mediterranean Sea is modelled. 

## How do you run the project
First, make sure that you have Python==>3.0 installed and all requirements mentioned in requirements.in are installed in the environment. 
Calling main.py will run and calling plots.py will generate the plot in the ./results/ directory. 
The user may change initial temperature or salinity values, change the imposed forcing over the box, change the parameters.
